    # Only supports CRAFTING at the moment. DO NOT CHANGE
    type: CRAFTING
    # Shape consists of 3 lines (3 letters each line).
    # You can imagine this is the crafting table.
    # Space character ' ' can be used as empty slot.
    # NOTE: A void using Unicode characters as they
    # usually use more than 1 byte to represent a character.
    # This may break the interpreter.
    shape:
    - "LII"
    - "  I"
    - "RII"
    # Now you will define what each letter stands for
    # You can't define space character ' ' as they are interpreted
    # as empty slot by default.
    #
    # L: LAPIS_LAZULI
    # Key 'L' is the letter you used in the shape
    # 'LAPIS_LAZULI' is the material.
